Introduction
------------

Preconditioned functional gradient flow (PFG) is a particle-based sampling framework, which aims to minimize the KL divergence between particle samples and the target distribution with the gradient flow estimates within a parametric function class.


Installation
------------

Install the requirements with ::

   pip install -r requirements.txt


This package can be be installed from sources with the following command::

    python setup.py install
